# Bank-Account-Management
A Java project to create bank accounts (Regular or with interest) with methods for deposit, withdraw and transfer with UI.

This is a java project that creates a bank system. The user is allowed to create multiple bank accounts. 

There are 2 types of accounts, a regural one and a savings one. The difference is that in the savings account, there is an interest rate.

In the accounts, you are allowed to deposit some money, withdraw some money or transfer some money to another existing account.

The panels change with the help of CardLayout. In the first panel you have the following options:

1. Create a new account by adding the user name and the user balance,

2. Create a new savings account by adding the user name, the user balance and the interest rate,

3. Log in to your account.

In the second panel, at the top left is the name of the user and at the top right is their balance. You also have the following options:

1. Deposit an amount of money,

2. Withdraw an amount of money,

3. Transfer an amount of money to another existing account,

4. Go back to the main panel.

For more information about how the code works, there are lots of comments in the .java files to help you understand everything and follow along with ease!
